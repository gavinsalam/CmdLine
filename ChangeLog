	* CmdLine.hh: 

	  added CmdLine::value_prefix<T>(opt,prefix), which interprets
	  the value of opt by placing the prefix in front of it
	   
	  added CmdLine::value<T>(opt,default,prefix), which interprets
	  the value of opt by placing the prefix in front of it

	  Both can be useful when reading in enums that all share a common
	  prefix.
